Thanks for visiting the online home of the Western New York Human Rights Clinic, a new initiative by led by medical students from the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in partnership with Jewish Family Services Center for Survivors of Torture, Physicians for Human Rights, and local health care providers.

Modeled after successful asylum medical-legal clinics at other institutions, our primary function is to provide medical and psychological forensic examinations to victims of political violence and survivors of torture who have fled their homeland and are seeking asylum in the United States.
