Thanks for visiting the online home of the Western New York Human Rights Clinic, a new initiative by led by a parternship between students from University at Buffalo School of Medicine, Jewish Family Services Center for Survivors of Torture, and local health care providers. Our primary function is to provide forensic examinations to survivors of torture who have fled their homeland and are seeking asylum in the United States. 

We are modeled after similar student-run clinics at Cornell, Columbia, and Brown.
